### Data

Raw data was downloaded from the GEO database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi) with ID **GSE167494**.

The metadata.csv file provided here was adapted from the supplementary table 2 (TableS2) in the original publication (Sadick et al.,2022). 
The following samples were removed due to computational limitations: D1-2, D9-D11, D13, and all SOX9pos, SOX9neg.
However, we ensured that remaining samples contained age and sex-matched cases of Alzheimer's disease and non-symptomatic brains.
